# ATM INTERFACE SYSTEM - PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## Project Overview
The ATM Interface System is a comprehensive Java-based application that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This console-based system provides a realistic banking experience with multiple user roles, secure authentication, and persistent data storage. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including object-oriented design, file handling, user authentication, and transaction processing.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The system follows an object-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Classes**:
   - Abstract `User` class serves as the base for different user types
   - `Customer` and `Admin` classes extend the base User class with role-specific functionality
   - `Account` class manages financial data and operations
   - `Transaction` class represents financial transactions with timestamps
   - `ATM` class orchestrates the overall system operation
   - `FileStorage` utility handles data persistence

2. **Data Persistence**:
   The application implements a file-based database system using text files:
   - `users.txt` - Stores user credentials and roles (CUSTOMER/ADMIN, ID, PIN)
   - `accounts.txt` - Maintains account information (User ID, Account Number, Balance)
   - `transactions.txt` - Records transaction history (User ID, Type, Amount, Balance, Timestamp)

3. **Security Features**:
   - PIN-based authentication system
   - Role-based access control (Customer vs Admin privileges)
   - Input validation to prevent invalid operations
   - Transaction logging for audit purposes

## Functional Features

### Customer Features
- Secure login with User ID and PIN
- Account balance inquiry
- Cash deposit functionality
- Cash withdrawal with balance validation
- Transaction history viewing
- Secure logout

### Admin Features
- System administration capabilities
- User account management
- System monitoring functionality

## Technical Highlights

1. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Inheritance hierarchy (User â†’ Customer/Admin)
   - Encapsulation of data within appropriate classes
   - Abstraction of common functionality
   - Polymorphic behavior based on user roles

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust exception handling for file operations
   - Input validation to prevent invalid transactions
   - Graceful error recovery mechanisms

3. **Data Management**:
   - Persistent storage across application sessions
   - Transaction logging with timestamps
   - Real-time balance updates

## Development Approach
The project was developed using an incremental approach:

1. Core class structure design and implementation
2. User authentication system development
3. Transaction processing functionality implementation
4. File-based persistence layer creation
5. User interface refinement
6. Comprehensive testing and debugging

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Java programming fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming principles
- File I/O operations
- Data persistence techniques
- User authentication implementation
- Console-based user interface design
- Error handling and input validation
- Software architecture principles

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future development include:

- Graphical user interface implementation
- Database integration (replacing text files)
- Enhanced security features (encryption, multi-factor authentication)
- Additional banking features (transfers, bill payments)
- Administrative reporting capabilities
